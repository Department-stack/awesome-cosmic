# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request to the following guidelines:

- Try to make your pull request as descriptive as possible, especially the title. "Update Readme.md" makes it harder for us to see directly what your pull request is about.
- Use the KISS principle for descriptions.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Please check your grammar and spelling as much as possible.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Please check that your contribution follows the following requirements :
  - The application has to follow enough of the KDE Visual Design Group/HIG.
  - Please avoid unmaintained items. 
  - Please avoid items that haven't had any stable release.
  - Please label official KDE Projects.

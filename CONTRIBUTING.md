# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request to the following guidelines:

- Try to make your pull request as descriptive as possible, especially the title. "Update Readme.md" makes it harder for us to see directly what your pull request is about.
- Use the KISS principle for descriptions.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Please check your grammar and spelling as much as possible.
- Make sure your text editor is setup correctly and doesn't adjust spaces and/or tabs.
- Improvements and additions to the existing content are always welcome.
- The application should follow enough of the [KDE Visual Design Group/HIG](https://community.kde.org/KDE_Visual_Design_Group/HIG).
- Please avoid unmaintained items. 
- Please label official KDE Projects.
